# SMZ3Randomizer

This is a fork of the Super Metroid &amp; A Link to the Past Crossover Item Randomizer. 
Unlike the original, it does not expect you to do any Infinite Bomb Jumps (IBJ) as part of the normal item progression logic.

The original repository can be found at <https://github.com/tewtal/SMZ3Randomizer>.
